# odin-recipes
Recipes and the descriptions of how to prepare and cook certain chosen recipes from the website allrecipes.com.
The project will be set up firstly with an index page then using three recipe pages, the first will be Lasagne and two others of a random choice.
In the course of the learning curve to arrive at this point, it was learning html and setting up GitHub, installing various software packages and Ubuntu on the WS1 windows framework.
Following the Odin tutorials and instructions has enabled me to proceed at a steady pace and I look forward to styling the pages with css on the next topic
